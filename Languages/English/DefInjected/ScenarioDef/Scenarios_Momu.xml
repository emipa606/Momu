  <MomuStart.scenario.parts.18.text>Well, here you are - your new home. You packed your supplies and left your colony behind for a brand new start at life. \n\n The food you brought won't last forever, so it's vital to get some plants in the ground as soon as you have a shelter. \n\n Remember, Momu can't eat meat or regular meals - Raw food like Corn, Potatoes or Rice will do until you can begin to make platters. Remember to forage for fruit while you can!</MomuStart.scenario.parts.18.text>
