--- Original Description ---
Friendly, communal and vegetarian rabbit people! Beta version, please contact Rekasa#0001 on discord with bugs!

The Momu are a rabbit-like people who eat raw vegetarian food. They don't mind sharing a barracks, and are happy when working as long as they have a friend nearby. They don't like mining very much, but most of them are quite good at growing food!

They can wear equipment and clothes from humans, but you can make your own apparel at the tailor bench, and special bows and knives at the smithy.

Remember to get crops going early! You can't hunt for meat, and foraging only lasts so long.

If you combine raw potatoes and raw corn at a stove, you can make a 'vegetable medley', which is a Fine Meal for the Momu!
If you add sunflower oil to the vegetable medley, it counts as a Lavish Meal! Yum!

You can now grow sunflowers, which have tasty seeds. You can refine the seeds into sunflower oil!

Their tech level is medieval.

Momu factions in the world start out friendly. They'll help you out, but don't get on their bad side! They're very numerous, and better equipped than tribals.


Big thanks to Goob and Serpy (art) and Ogliss (xml)!
Thanks to the countless people who helped make this mod a reality. I love you all.
